#Summary

As a designer turned developer, I enjoy declarative polymorphic code in frameworks like Node.js, AngularJS, and React; I treat code like I was taught to treat design: as a work of precious art, where the craftsmanship during creation is just as important as the final work. On that note, I have spearheaded the refactoring of certain projects which contain copious amounts of spaghetti code to refine the work into a more beautiful creation. It has been said among my peers that I make code more readable and maintainable. This is also in part due to my effective communication skills in which I use clear, concise language to communicate creative concepts and visions to my counterparts. I enjoy organization and management processes, and am not afraid to step up and own delegation responsibilities.

## What I've Done ##

- Lead engineering meetings in an iterative product development team environment
- Pair programmed with less experienced web developers
- Collaborated on a multifaceted product development team using `Git` and `Giflow` at [meadifire.com][4]
- Maintained deployments in a repository based development work flow, complete with unit testing and Continuous Integration tools
- Worked for a startup managing and implementing various creative web development jobs from design to deployment 
- Single-handedly road-mapped and scoped the minimum viable product during the seed phases of funding for [Arena Online][1], an eSports tech startup
- Designed/Developed comprehensive user interfaces for [Arena Online][1], [z0lver][2], Texas Children's Hospital, Schlumberger, Alcoa & more.
- Created mobile applications for `iOS` and `Android` deployment with the `Ionic Framework`
- Written in-depth `Javascript` and `SASS/CSS` code style guides for [Arena Online][1]
- Successfully developed the entire front end code in parallel for [z0lver][2] in one week remotely
- Implemented `C#` and `C++` code to create interactive game UIs for real-time 3D applications in `Unity` and `Unreal`

## My Desires ##

- Continue to level up my full-stack web development chops, preferably in the Devops
- Participate in the prolonged design and development of a product or product family in an iterative environment
- Delve deeper in UX research and engineering
- Continue to deploy and maintain near bleeding edge technologies in the wild
- Learn more about iterative project management and the agile process
  
# Major Projects

### Schlumberger QRG ###
_[iOS App][3] & custom CMS - Global 500 Oil & Gas - `MongoDB`, `Express.js`, `AngularJS`, `Node.js`_

Schlumbergerâ€™s Quick Reference Guide (QRG) solved the need of delivering up-to-date product specifications to clients in constantly changing markets while reducing overhead and risk for Marcom (marketing and communications). The requirements included extremely tight security thresholds and the restriction that any web services had to be developed on an internal bare-metal infrastructure

I provisioned the server to run the `Node.js REST API` I developed using a process management tool called `PM2`. The delivery process used `Git` to deploy directly onto the server's file system where `PM2` would create, fork, restart and kill application instances as needed with zero downtime. This allowed for efficient usage of physical resources without the overhead of virtualization. The final deliverables included a `Node.js REST API` leveraging `MongoDB`, an `iOS` app to consume the REST API, and a custom browser based content management application to manage the catalog online.

### The Arena Online ###
_[http://www.arenaonline.com/][1] - eSports tech startup - `MongoDB`, `Express.js`, `AngularJS`, `Node.js`_

Arena Online allows you to play free automated tournaments online for cash, prizes and reputation any time you want. Both the website (currently in Public Beta) and the web app (currently in R&D) are very ambitious Single-Page Application projects. 

At Arena Online, I oversaw all front end design and development before any public release. Additionally, on occasion I contributed to backend development. Much of my time working with Arena Online included...

- Planning and designing features for development
- Developing `Angular` `modules`, `directives` and `services`
- Implementing pixel perfect design mockups in `Jade` and `SCSS`
- Assisting in complex branching and merging in `Git`

### z0lver ###
_[http://z0lver.com/][2] - educational electronic engineering software - `QT`, `C++`, `QML`_

Funded by the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office (MTO), and U.S. Army Research Office (ARO), z0lver is a cross-platform transmission line and circuit solver (or z0lver) that links schematic capture, analysis and visualization, and fabrication of printed RF/microwave circuits into three respective UIs: Build, Eval, and Make as depicted on their website.

Since this was an extremely technical project, the product owners wished to hire Abstract Media for the design/development of the front end. This was to ensure that users who are new to the concepts that z0lver implements would have an intuitive interface when using the application. With `QT` as the library of choice, we were able to completely abstract the logic layer from the UI layer. This allowed me to develop fully functional object oriented UI modules and components in `QML`, while the underlying logic inter-operated in `C++`.

## Various Experiences ##
My career began in 2010 when I graduated high-school a year early. Upon graduating, I founded digital-everything as a photography, design & cinema company. I also founded and managed a Christian music competition known as Worship Warriors in 2010. In 2012, the art department at JBU hired me to attend a trip to London and generate a highlight reel for marketing purposes. I have traveled to teach English & Bible classes in China and Ecuador as a part of my Christian vocation. With several years experience in music, I love playing percussion. In the past, I have contributed to 3 separate albums. I also DJ as a hobby. I love learning, being involved in unique, stimulating environments, and always read too many books at once.
